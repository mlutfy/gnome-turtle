TODO / BUGS

Critical
--------

- Fix Fx factors, where x = natural number, so that we can draw fractals such
  as the Dragon-Curve.

- Add Fx factors to - / + ?

Non critical bugs
-----------------

- Printing prints upside down (?)

- Add zoom factor (to replace AMP constant)

Why not
-------

- Add dialog to enter new lsys definitions, to be more interactive.

- Allow comments in the input files.

- Allow input of multi-lingual documents. This would be an evil plot to
  encourage people to use UTF-8 in non-latin languages, but it would be
  entertaining to be, as I'm not sure how to do it with flex/bison.

- Similar to the point above, allow LC_NUMERIC depending on locale or
  read format (?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recently finished/fixed (see ChangeLog for more information)
-----------------------

- LC_NUMERIC forced to "C"

- Build "my_autogen" deletes source files on "make clean" and does not build
  flex/bison files (run "bison -d turtle-parser.y; flex turtle-parser.l").

- Add printing functionality (libgnomeprint).
