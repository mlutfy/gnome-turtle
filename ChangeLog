	* README : Clarified information on how to build the application.

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : When the screen is cleared, print, save and other
		related menus are accordingly greyed out.

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : Added support for menu Edit -> Clear.

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : When a new fractal is loaded (File->Open), the
		screen is cleared from the previous drawing (helps avoid cluttering
		the system's memory).

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : When the screen is cleared, print, save and other
		related menus are accordingly greyed out.
	
	* configure.in : Version bumped to 0.1.2 from 0.1.1, and updated the link
		to the bug tracking system.

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : LC_NUMERIC now forced to "C"

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : Added Open dialog, but it doesn't clear the canvas (!)

	* src/gnome-turtle.c, src/turtle-helpers.c : Added basic printing.

	* src/gnome-turtle.c : menus now look normal (Game replaced by File, added
	Print, etc.) and changed the callback names.

	* configure.in : added Lex/Yacc support.

	* src/turtle-parser.l : renamed to src/turtle-scanner.l (this was causing
		a very strange problem with automake/autoconf, badly included .h, etc.).
